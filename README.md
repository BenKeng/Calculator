# Calculator
General information:
Code can only preform mathimatical operations with two numbers.
Mathematical actions are limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
1: Asks the user to enter the first number.
2: Tries to turn that input into an integer. If it fails (e.g., user types “abc”), it prints “Invalid input.”
3: Asks the user which operation they want (+, -, *, or /). If the choice is not one of these, it prints “Invalid input.”
4: Asks the user to enter the second number.
5: Tries to turn that into an integer. If it fails, it prints “Invalid input.”
6: If the action is valid, performs the chosen math operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
7: If division is chosen and the second number is 0, it warns “Division by zero is not possible.”
8: Displays the result of the calculation in the terminal.
